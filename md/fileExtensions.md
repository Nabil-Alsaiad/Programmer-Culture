# File Extensions

What exists in a file name after a `.` (dot) to define the type of data stored in it, programs rely on file extensions to know how to read the data stored in the file, changing the file extension doesn't affect the content inside it, it just makes the human/program think that what's contained in the file is different from what's actually stored in it
